# 🔄 Plugin Update Required

## Issue Identified
The enhanced component extraction code has been successfully implemented, but Figma is running a **cached version** of the old plugin code.

**Evidence from logs:**
```
BEFORE (old cached code running):
- "Processing first 10 components only for memory safety" 
- "EMERGENCY memory safe mode enabled. Limiting to 8 components maximum"
- "ULTRA SAFE MODE: Limiting to 5 components only"

SHOULD BE (with new enhanced code):
- "Using smart prioritization to select 50 most important components"
- "PRIORITY MODE: Using smart selection to focus on 20 priority UI components"  
- "ULTRA SAFE MODE: Selecting 15 diverse UI components"
```

## 🚀 How to Apply the Update

### Option 1: Reload Plugin in Figma
1. In Figma, go to **Plugins** → **Development** → **Import plugin from manifest**
2. Select the `manifest.json` file from this directory
3. This will reload the plugin with the enhanced code

### Option 2: Restart Figma
1. Close Figma completely
2. Restart Figma
3. Reload your design file
4. Run the plugin again

### Option 3: Clear Plugin Cache (if needed)
1. In Figma, go to **Help** → **Troubleshooting**
2. Click **Clear cache and restart**

## ✅ Expected Results After Update

### Component Discovery
Instead of finding only **5 icon components**, you should now see:

**🎯 Smart Prioritization Active:**
- Buttons: High priority (score 115-135)
- Form inputs: High priority (score 95-115)  
- Cards/Modals: Medium priority (score 80-85)
- Navigation/Tables: Medium priority (score 70-75)
- Feedback components: Lower priority (score 60)
- Icons: Lowest priority (score 10-30)

### New Log Messages
You should see logs like:
```
🎯 Component Prioritization Results:
  1. Button/Primary (score: 135)
  2. Input/Text Field (score: 115)  
  3. Form/Login (score: 90)
  4. Card/Product (score: 85)
  5. Modal/Dialog (score: 80)
  ... (diverse UI components)
  15. Icon/Search (score: 10)
```

### Enhanced Markdown Output
The generated markdown will now include:

```markdown
## 🧩 Component Library

### Component Overview
**Total Components Found:** 15+

- 🎯 **Interactive:** 3 components (buttons, toggles)
- 📝 **Form Controls:** 2 components (inputs, selects)
- 📦 **Layout:** 2 components (containers, grids)
- 📄 **Content:** 3 components (cards, panels)
- 💫 **Feedback:** 2 components (loading, alerts)
- 🧭 **Navigation:** 2 components (menus, tabs)
- 🖼️ **Media:** 1 components (avatars, icons)
```

## 🧪 Verification Test

After reloading, look for these specific improvements in the logs:

1. **Higher component limits**: Should process 15-50 components instead of 5
2. **Smart prioritization**: Should show component scoring and selection
3. **Diverse component types**: Should find buttons, forms, tables, etc. instead of just icons
4. **Enhanced categories**: Markdown should show component type breakdown

## 🔧 Enhanced Features Now Active

- **Smart Component Prioritization**: UI components prioritized over decorative elements
- **Increased Memory Limits**: 50 max components vs 10 previously
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced regex patterns for better component type detection
- **Category-based Selection**: Ensures diverse component types in output
- **Enhanced Markdown**: Better organization and component type summaries

The enhancement is complete - just needs a plugin reload to activate! 🎉
